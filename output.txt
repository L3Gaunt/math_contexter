of @@@ order &&& 1. But this is a contradiction to the @@@ residue theorem &&& of @@@ complex analysis &&&: the @@@ sum &&& of the @@@ residues &&& of any rational (@@@ or &&& meromorphic &&&) differential form on a compact Riemann &&& surface is zero, but in our case we have @@@ ∑ &&&Q∈X @@@ res &&&Q(@@@ ϕ &&&·@@@ α &&&) = res@@@ P &&&(@@@ ϕ &&&·@@@ α &&&) @@@ 6= &&& 0.
Step 3. We claim that

for all divisors D. Note that we can choose points @@@ P &&&1,...,@@@ P &&&r such that @@@ D &&&+@@@ P &&&1 +···+@@@ P &&&r
is
precisely the intersection divisor of X with a certain number n of hyperplanes: for every
point in D we just choose a hyperplane through that point and add all other intersection
points with X to the @@@ P &&&i
. This then means that O(@@@ D &&&+@@@ P &&&1 +···+@@@ P &&&r) = O(n). By possibly
adding more intersection points of X with hyperplanes we can make n arbitrarily large. So
by example 7.7.2 we find that
